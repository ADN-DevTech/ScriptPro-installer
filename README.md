ScriptPro-installer
===================

ScriptPro 2.0 is a batch processing utility that applies a set of commands to multiple drawings. Simply specify a script file that contains the commands you want to run on a single drawing, and then use ScriptPro 2.0 to apply that script to as many drawings as you like. ScriptPro 2.0 handles opening and closing each drawing for you. ScriptPro 2.0 takes AutoCAD scripting to a new level with an easy-to-use interface, logging, reusable project files and robust error recovery so your processing continues even when AutoCAD can't.
